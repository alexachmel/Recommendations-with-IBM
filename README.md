# Recommendations-with-IBM

For this project I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like.

Installations:
In this project Python 3.x and the following Python libraries were installed:
1. Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/
2. Numpy https://numpy.org/
3. Matplotlib.pyplot https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html
4. Pickle https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
5. Sklearn (metrics) https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

Data:
1. Articles' description - articles_community.csv
2. Users' interactions with articles - user-item-interactions.csv

There are 6 parts in this project:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

II. Rank Based Recommendations

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations (skipped for now)
V. Matrix Factorization
VI. Extras & Concluding
